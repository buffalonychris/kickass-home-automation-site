<p>Best home automation system overall</p>
<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Home Assistant is an open source smart home platform for connected devices. It runs locally, with minimal reliance on the cloud, so it can keep your smart home devices connected even if your internet connection fails. It works with over a thousand integrations, including Matter, which makes this the most versatile smart home automation system</p>
<h3>Who it&#x27;s for</h3><p>Home Assistant (HA) used to be reserved for tech-savvy users and tinkerers, but it&#x27;s also accessible enough for entry-level smart home users to integrate it into their homes.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re not a tech wiz, you can get the Home Assistant Green, a hub for the smart home platform that makes it easy to set up and use. If you like to tinker with your connected devices, you can run HA on a Raspberry Pi, an Odroid, or an x86-64 machine. Either way, you&#x27;ll have complete control of your smart home devices.</p>
<h3>Who should look elsewhere</h3><p>While setting up HA is easier than ever, there are other simpler, plug-and-play solutions that are natively built into Android and iOS devices. These include Google Home and Apple HomeKit, respectively. If you&#x27;d rather stick with a simpler solution than HA, you should read on about our options below.</p>
